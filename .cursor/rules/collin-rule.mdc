Follow folder structure:
   - /components: shared components
   - /screens: React Native views
   - /utils: helper functions
3. Use async/await instead of .then chaining.
4. Prefer arrow functions for callbacks.
5. All API requests go through /services/api.js
6. Avoid using `console.log`, use a custom logger.
8. For navigation, use React Navigation and group stack/screen files logically.
